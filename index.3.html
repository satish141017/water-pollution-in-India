            <h1>Major Causes<br></h1>
            <P><em>Industrial waste </em>: Industrial activities such as manufacturing, mining, and construction generate a significant amount of waste that often contains toxic chemicals, heavy metals, and other pollutants. When this waste is not properly treated and disposed of, it can find its way into water bodies, leading to water pollution.</br>

                <em>Agricultural activities</em> : Pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals used in farming can contaminate water sources through runoff, leaching, and direct discharge. Livestock waste is also a significant contributor to water pollution.</br>
                
                <em>Domestic waste</em> : Untreated or inadequately treated sewage and wastewater from households can also pollute water sources. In many developing countries, there is a lack of proper sanitation facilities and sewage treatment plants, leading to untreated human waste being discharged into water bodies.</br>
                
                <em>Oil spills</em> : Accidental or intentional oil spills can have a devastating impact on marine ecosystems, killing wildlife and contaminating water sources.<br>
                <em>Climate change</em> : Climate change can also contribute to water pollution through altered rainfall patterns and increased flooding, which can wash pollutants into water sources.</P>
